This module contains a collection of useful mutators.

- `WeightedNullabilityMutator`: Given a weight between 0 and 1, will mutate a generator to provided interspersed null
  values in accordance with the provided weight
- `CollectionMutator`: Takes a standard generator and converts it to a `List` generator

If you would like to add a mutator to the standard collection, please first open an
issue [here](https://github.com/unredundant/satisfaketion/issues) explaining the use case.
